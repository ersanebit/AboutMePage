    <h4>Student at KEA - Copenhagen School Of Design And Technology</h4>

    <p>My name is Ersan, I am 20 years old and I am a student in the 4th semester at KEA - Copenhagen School Of Design and Technology
         in computer science. My objective is to bring the most value I can in the process of developing the project for the company, 
         working in a team and using my programming/system development/bussines knowledge and problem solving skills. </p>
          <p>  Previous group projects in school taught me the importance of team work, communication and management when it comes to software development. 
            I am a reliable person, great at time management, motivated to always learn new skills, but also to improve the ones I already have. 
            I am well organised regarding my work and the flexibility of my schedule allows me to work extra-time if needed.</p>
           <p> My passions (besides programming) include dancing, psychology, making music, editing videos, movies, reading, travelling, video games.</p>
